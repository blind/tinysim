# Tiny Arcade Simulator

This is an embryo of a simulator for Tiny Arcade, to simplify development of new and cool games.

## Goal

The goal is to be able to compile the same code for both the real Tiny Arcade hardware and
the simulator. 

## Implementation

To allow users on different platforms I chose to implemented it using SDL2. 


### Current status

The coding have just started, so only the display part is implemented. 


### Planned features

 * Simulate SPI and Wire interfaces.
 * Simulate Serial interface for pringing logs.
 * Simulate support for basic arduino functionality like Delay function.
 * Implement sound output.
 * Joystick and button input simulation.
